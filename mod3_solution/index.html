      <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
        (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
        of 23.7 billion as of 2018. up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world
        than any other bird or domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming
        both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special
        ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).</p>
       <p>    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,
        but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
        Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the
        "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
        according to the annals of Thutmose III.

      <h3 class="text-center">Beef</h3>
      <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle.
        Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.</p>
      <p>Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts,
        short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
        while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed
        with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood
        is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal,
        such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and
        thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine
        spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles
        of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some
        intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings.
        The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

      <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
      <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice
        (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta),
        such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one
        key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).</p>
      <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
        short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
        imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi,
        and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
      <p>Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced
        raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
